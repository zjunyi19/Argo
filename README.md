# Argo
Argo project for Statistic research
Using R, C++ and Shiny

main.cpp is my first version used to calculate B_matrix and Omega_matrix
modified_basis_functions.cpp is used to get Omega matrix.
basis_functions.cpp is used to generate B matrix.
All the runtime is must faster than using fda package in R.
